# 🍽️ Restaurant Management System using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The Restaurant Management System is a Python-based application designed to simulate the basic operations of a restaurant. The system allows users to view the menu, place orders, calculate the total bill, and manage customer interactions through a simple and user-friendly interface.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Restaurants require an efficient system to manage orders and billing. Manual order handling can be time-consuming and error-prone.  
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based restaurant system that automates the ordering and billing process using basic programming concepts.
